<p>As you all know, Grandpa, in his healthier days, loved growing all kinds of plants, indoors and out. I want to share some of the lessons he taught me through his gardening. I’m no gardener, but I’ll attempt to translate.</p>
<p>First off, wait until the time and weather are right. Then plant the biggest garden you can reasonably take care of! Fertilize it well: often doubling the recommended amount of Miracle Gro you mix into your watering can. Be bold in pruning away the dead stems and flowers, or any branches that might prevent you from mowing under something. These will only suck energy away from the rest of the plant. They will also suck the energy from you, especially if you’re constantly thinking about how you can’t mow under it! Clearing away the dead foliage also makes way for new growth. Don’t forget to water your plants, and patiently shoo away the rabbits and birds that try to eat your vegetables.</p>
<p>Pick as many strawberries, corn, and zucchini as possible every year. And then eat them. And can them. And freeze them. You never know what you might need in the coming winter. When it’s all said and done, give them freely--along with the rest of your harvest--to friends, neighbors, children, grandchildren, and even people you might not especially like. And there are plenty of people you might not especially like. Nobody says you have to like everybody. But giving them some gourds now and then is a small sacrifice and pays off in the end, and that way nothing is ever wasted.</p>
<p>Growing vegetables, then, is a lot like raising children, grandchildren, and responsible members of society. Hardly a Sunday dinner went by without his reminding us that poorly behaved children and irresponsible adults are the products of poorly behaved and irresponsible parents. Almost all of the advice he gave us was unsolicited--and ranged from Why You Shouldn’t Wear a Hat Inside to Why You Should Save Money and Go to Gollege to Why You Should Not Blow Your Nose at the Table. And most weeks he reminded us of how extremely lucky we all are. He did this by telling us that when he was our age, he and his brothers thought a bacon grease sandwich for lunch was about the best thing ever. All these pieces of advice and what we sometimes perceived as harsh criticisms came from a place of love, responsibility, and duty. Not only did he want us to be better people, but he wanted society to be better because of us. Little did we realize at the time that we were so much like his flowers. The whole time he was watering and feeding and trying to prune away our superfluous and weak attributes.</p>
<p>His sense of responsibility for us continues to make itself manifest even as we speak. Grandpa gave his body to Wright State University where it is being used for medical research and teaching. It might even be used to learn how to prevent strokes. But in addition to this deed being generous in and of itself, it shines forth as example of generosity we should all have the courage to imitate.</p>
<p>Indeed none of us would be who we are today without having had Grandpa. I don’t doubt we would all be much less accomplished gardeners of our own lives.</p>
