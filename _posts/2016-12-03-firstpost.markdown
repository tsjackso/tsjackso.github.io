Ohai, world!  On December 4, 2016, we're having our first snow in Chicago. UA-6160939-2 ❄️  

   here's some text
   
The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.

Some `plain text` text

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
