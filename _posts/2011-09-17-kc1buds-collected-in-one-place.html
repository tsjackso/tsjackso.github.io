<p>Oh, my. I think I got a rush just from looking at that photo. What a lovely stash.</p>
<p>I am alive and well in Norwalk. Nothing exciting to report at all. I am struggling through a bout of depression (we can share things like that with each other, right?) which makes communication difficult. I am trying to get out and do what I can, but it is a push.</p>
<p>My little knitting group seems to be taking root, to the point that we are discussing a name for ourselves. I am voting for Yarn Therapy or Knit Therapy as I can imagine saying "I have therapy (or my therapy group) tonight."</p>
<p>I have been working on the Sideways Surprise Shawlette the last week. I bought both the pattern and the yarn at the market at KC. After I screwed up the pulling from the cake with both ends technique, I rolled the yarn into two balls. I weighed them on my kitchen scale and knitted to the halfway point before beginning to decrease. I am nearing the end of the pattern and it is smaller than I want it to be and I have a considerable amount of leftover yarn, so...I now have both a scale and a meter winging their way to me from Knitpicks.</p>
<p>Did go out tonight with friends to a fish fry (Lake Erie perch, Ted) in nearby Townsend, put on by the volunteer fire department. It is their yearly fundraiser and they do it very well. Wised up this year and avoided the sides, with the exception of some handcut fries, and focused on the endless perch. Very nice evening.</p>
<p>Came home to find out on FB that a young man from Craig's class committed suicide today. He was a great, apparently happy-go-lucky kid. I am stunned and heartbroken.</p>
<p>On the bright side, the yarn for Marie's shawl has arrived and I will be starting it soon. I am working on a few small baby items (a la Yarn Harlot) for my potential grandchild, whom I have named Figment. Feels good to put some things away.</p>
<p>Love you and miss you all. I will work on pulling through this stage by the time the girls hit Cleveland. I am looking forward to it.</p>
<p>&gt; Doesn't take up that much space for an entire hobby, right? Actually, TWO hobbies if you include spinning! (wheel is off to the right) &gt;<br />
&gt; Note how happy the cat is.<br />
