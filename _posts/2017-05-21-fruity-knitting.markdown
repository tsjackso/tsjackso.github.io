My friend James recently told me about a video podcast on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCry9BOQv1BhE5k9c9oHnxTw) called [Fruity Knitting](http://fruityknitting.com/).  Each episode is about an hour or an hour and a half long.  The hosts are Australian but live in Germany and are absolutely delightful to listen to.  It's like having friends talking to me while I knit, but I don't have to worry about engaging with them.  They interview a "knitter of the world" every episode which is also super interesting.  Overall, it's simply delightful and I look forward to watching many more episodes.
