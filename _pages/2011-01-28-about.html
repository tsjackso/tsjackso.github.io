<p>A college acquaintance's grandfather once gave him a camera and  enough film for him to take a picture every day for 365 days.  I've  always thought it was a neat idea, and I've decided that this will be my  30th birthday present to my future self.  In this day and age of easy  and portable photography (iPhone) as well as ubiquitous network access  (unlimited data plan) there are really no more barriers to my carrying  out a similar project.</p>
<p>Join me for a picture every day for the 365 that begin on February 3, 2011!</p>
<p>I can't guarantee ahead of time that the pictures will appear on the  blog in a timely fashion, or that they will be groundbreaking photos,  but I hope to at least take a usable photo each day and then post it as I  am able.</p>
<p>It's going to be a good year, I can tell!</p>
